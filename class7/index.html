# Feature Engineering - The Importance
> ##Actually the success of all machine learning algorithms depends on how you present the data.

#Feature Engineering - A Definition
> ##The process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data

#Feature Engineering - Important Factors
--

+ The data you’re using
--

+ The domain you’re working in
--

+ The models you’re working with

---

# Feature Engineering - Strategies
--

+ Use integers to encode features

![img-center-80](../images/feature1.png)
--

+ Discretize continuous values
--

+ Create dummy variables (but be sure to leave one out)

---

#Feature Engineering - Keep In Mind
--

+ Choices made will impact the results
--

+ It's more an art than a science

---

#Linear regression vs classification
--

+ Linear Regression -> predict continuous ordinal value
--

+ Classification -> predict discrete categorical value
