#Introductions
--

+ Your name
--

+ Briefly describe your background
--

+ Tell us one thing you’d like to get out of this class

---

#Assumptions
--

+ You’re all journalists or interested in journalistic tradecraft as it relates to data
--

+ You’re not computer scientists
--

+ You’re not interested in creating the next Facebook (unless it’s for journalists)
--

+ You’re not great at math (don’t worry, I’m not either)
--

+ You care more about the why than the how

--

+ You will understand how algorithms are applied in the newsroom

---

#Course Policies
--

+ Attendance and Tardiness – Show up to every class and be on time
--

+ Participation – Take an active role in your learning
--

+ Late Assignments – Get your work in on time
