#Reading/Watching

+ "[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver: Scientific Studies](https://youtu.be/0Rnq1NpHdmw)"

---

#Assignment 1
+ Use the data from `heights_weights_genders.csv` to create a simple predictor that takes in a person's height and guesses their weight based on a model using all the data, regardless of gender
+ Find the weights and use those in your function (i.e. don't generate a model each time)

---

#Assignment 2
+ Create two models for the relationship between height and weight based on gender 
+ Modify the code in Assignment 1 to ask for a person's gender as well as their height to produce an estimate of a person's weight using the models you created
+ Find the weights and use those in your function (i.e. don't generate a model each time)

---

#Assignment 3
+ Using the data from the `2013_NYC_CD_MedianIncome_Recycle.xlsx` file, create a predictor using the weights from the model. This time, use the built in attributes in your model rather than hard-coding them into your algorithm

---

#Assignment 4
+ Using data from [this FiveThirtyEight post](http://53eig.ht/1e2aV6U), write code to calculate the correlation of the responses from the poll.
+ Respond to the story in your PR. Is this a good example of data journalism? Why or why not?

---

#Goals for today
+ Discuss statistical measures


---

#Null Hypothesis
--

+ Start with the belief there is no relationship between variables
--

+ Either reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject the hypothesis
--

+ “Failing to reject” doesn’t mean we accept the null -> we may not have enough data
--

+ The alternative hypothesis is that there is a relationship between the variables

---

#p-value
+ The probability of getting results at least as extreme as those observed, given that the null hypothesis is correct

#Data Types
--

+ Nominal (Categorical) - Examples: ID numbers, eye color, zip codes
--

+ Ordinal -  Examples: rankings (e.g., taste of potato chips on a scale from 1-10), grades, height in {tall, medium, short}
--

+ Interval - Examples: calendar dates, temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit
--

+ Ratio - Examples: temperature in Kelvin, length, time, counts

---

#Continuous values
--

+ Has real numbers as attribute values
--

+ Examples: temperature, height, or weight
--

+ Practically, real values can only be measured and represented using a finite number of digits
--

+ Continuous attributes are typically represented as floating-point variables
---

#Discrete values
--

+ Has only a finite or countably infinite set of values
--

+ Examples: zip codes, counts, or the set of words in a collection of documents
--

+ Often represented as integer variables
--

+ Note: binary attributes are a special case of discrete attributes

---

#Interpreting Coefficients
--

+ Positive coefficients indicate a positive effect on the outcome
--

+ Negative coefficients indicate a negative effect on the outcome
--

+ Greater distance from 0, the greater the effect
--

+ Possible to trim features with coefficients near 0 to get better results

---

#Simple Logistic Regression
--

+ Predicts the probability an event occurs (classification)
--

+ Fits data to a logit function logistic curve
--

+ Used to explore associations between one binary outcome and one (continuous, ordinal, or categorical) feature
--

+ Lets you answer questions like, "how does gender affect the probability of having hypertension?”

---

#Multiple Logistic Regression
--

+ Used to explore associations between one binary outcome variable and two or more features (which may be continuous, ordinal or categorical)
--

+ Coefficients describe the nature of the relationship

---

#How It Works
--

+ Given a set of features, the algorithm calculates the probability it belongs to class 1
--

+ P(y=1)/P(y=0) 
--

+ Then take the logarithm of the odds ratio
--

+ Provides a result bounded by 0 and 1
--

+ Predicts the class for the instance
